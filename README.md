This application involves receiving voice input from users, converting it into text, and offering solutions to their medical inquiries. Responses are delivered in the form of text, speech, and images. The system integrates JinaChat, Google's gTTS, NLTK, Langchain, and HuggingFace Models to enable Text-To-Speech, Speech-To-Text, and Text-To-Image functionalities. The included code facilitates the automatic deployment of the model as a Streamlit Application.
